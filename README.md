# Tic-Tac-Toe
Inspired by my brother [@Nicholasprd](https://github.com/Nicholasprd) that made a tic-tac-toe project as college homework, I want to back to my college times and do this challenge again.

My first time doing this challenge, I was used too many `if` and `else` for each possible tricks and condition for `"IA"`. In 2012 my homework was make a Tic-Tac-Toe for human vs human and human vs `"IA"`. 

## Tricks

Are specific conditions that not give instant victory to the symbol. Tricks give to the symbol a 100% of chance to win the game in the next one or two turns, if the opponent don't do a precision play in next turn.

## Conditions

Are simple win conditions.

## About this version

In this version I try to remove conditions for specific positions of game and replace for methods that reads lists of positions for prevent tricks and apply tricks.
